-- In this module you're going to practice standard Haskell typeclasses:
--
--   * Deriving instances
--   * Using typeclasses methods
--   * Implementing instances manually
--   * Becoming friends with Semigroup, Monoid, Foldable and Functor typeclasses!

-- ðŸ†™ Bonus challenge 1: Could you implement this function in a such way
--  that it'll still work even if you change constructor names and their
--  order in the 'Weekday' type?
--
-- ðŸ†™ Bonus challenge 2: Now, could you improve the implementation so it
--  would work for **any** enumeration type in Haskell (e.g. 'Bool',
--  'Ordering') and not just 'Weekday'?

In the following block of tasks you need to implement 'Semigroup'
instances for all types and 'Monoid' instances if it's possible to
have a lawful 'Monoid' instance.

  { unGold :: Int
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Addition of gold coins.
instance Semigroup Gold where
  (<>) :: Gold -> Gold -> Gold
  (<>) (Gold x) (Gold y) = Gold (x + y)

instance Monoid Gold where
  mempty = Gold 0

-- | A reward for completing a difficult quest says how much gold
-- you'll receive and whether you'll get a special reward.
--
-- If you combine multiple rewards, the final reward will contain a
-- special prize if at least one of the rewards is special.
data Reward = Reward
  { rewardGold :: Gold,
    rewardSpecial :: Bool
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

instance Semigroup Reward where
  (<>) :: Reward -> Reward -> Reward
  (<>) (Reward goldA specialA) (Reward goldB specialB) = Reward (goldA <> goldB) (specialA || specialB)

instance Monoid Reward where
  mempty = Reward mempty False

-- | 'List1' is a list that contains at least one element.
data List1 a = List1 a [a]
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | This should be list append.

  (<>) (List1 lval l) (List1 kval k) = List1 lval (l ++ kval : k)

-- | Does 'List1' have the 'Monoid' instance? If no then why?

-- | When fighting a monster, you can either receive some treasure or
-- don't.

  = NoTreasure
  | SomeTreasure a
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | When you append multiple treasures for fighting multiple
-- monsters, you should get a combined treasure and not just the first
-- (or last one).

-- ðŸ•¯ HINT: You may need to add additional constraints to this instance
--  declaration.

  (<>) NoTreasure t = t
  (<>) t NoTreasure = t
  (<>) (SomeTreasure t) (SomeTreasure u) = SomeTreasure (t <> u)

{-

In the next block of tasks, implement 'Foldable' instances for all
types that can have such an instance.

â™« NOTE: Implement both 'foldr' and 'foldMap' methods. On the one hand,
  'Foldable' is a big typeclass but lets focus on its small part to get
  the main idea. On the other hand, these two methods are quite
  different so it's a good practice.

ðŸ•¯ HINT: Check kinds of types to see whether it's possible to implement
  an instance of 'Foldable'.

ðŸ•¯ HINT: If you don't feel comfortable with kinds yet, alternatively
  you can try uncommenting each instance one by one and see the GHC
  error. The compiler will "kindly" tell you if it's impossible to have
  such an instance.

ðŸ•¯ HINT: Write explicit type signature of methods using InstanceSigs
  (already enabled in this module).

â™« NOTE: Since the instances are commented, the tests are also commented.
  To run tests for your instances, go to the "test/Test/Lecture3.hs" file
  and uncomment all commented tests. But do this only after you
  implement instances! No spoilers :)

{-

In the next block of tasks, implement 'Functor' instances for all
types that can have such an instance.

ðŸ•¯ HINT: At this point, you already know which types can have 'Functor'
  instance and which don't (the same types as for 'Foldable' in this
  case). But comments still mention all types to avoid spoilers ;)

-- | Functions are first-class values in Haskell. This means that they
