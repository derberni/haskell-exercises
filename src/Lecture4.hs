-- Exercises for the Lecture 4 of the Haskell Beginners course.
--
-- In this task you're going to implement a complete Haskell Program!
--
-- The purpose of the program is to read information about various
-- product trades from a file, calculate some stats about buys and sells
-- and pretty-print them in the terminal.
--
-- The content of the file looks like this:
--
--
-- Name,Type,Amount
-- Apples,Sell,25
-- Tomatoes,Sell,10
-- Pineapples,Buy,50
--
--
-- Specifically:
--
--   1. The first line contains names of columns.
--   2. Each line contains exactly 3 comma-separated values.
--   3. The first value is a name of a product: a non-empty string
--      containing any characters except comma.
--   4. Second value is the type of trade. It's either a "Buy" or "Sell" string.
--   5. The last, third value, is a non-negative integer number: the cost
--      of the product.
--   6. Each value might be surrounded by any amount of spaces.
--   7. You don't need to trim spaces in the product name. But you need
--      to parse the other two values even if they contain leading and
--      trailing spaces.
--
-- Your program takes a path to a file and it should output several stats
-- about all the trades. The list of parameters to output is always the
-- same. Only values can change depending on file content.
--
-- For example, for the file content above, the program should print the following:
--
--
-- Total positions        : 3
-- Total final balance    : -15
-- Biggest absolute cost  : 50
-- Smallest absolute cost : 10
-- Max earning            : 25
-- Min earning            : 10
-- Max spending           : 50
-- Min spending           : 50
-- Longest product name   : Pineapples
--
--
-- To run the program, use the following command for specifying the
-- path (the repository already contains a small test file):
--
--
-- cabal run lecture4 -- test/products.csv
--
--
-- You can assume that the file exists so you don't need to handle such
-- exceptional situations. But you get bonus points for doing so :)
--
-- However, the file might contain data in an invalid format.
-- All possible content errors:
--
--   * There might not be the first line with column names
--   * Names of columns might be different
--   * Each line can have less than 3 or more than 3 values
--   * The product name string can be empty
--   * The second value might be different from "Buy" or "Sell"
--   * The number can be negative or not integer or not even a number
--
-- In this task, for simplicity reasons, you don't need to report any
-- errors. You can just ignore invalid rows.
--
-- Exercises for Lecture 4 also contain tests and you can run them as usual.

{- In this exercise, instead of writing the entire program from
scratch, you're offered to complete the missing parts.

Let's use this task as an opportunity to learn how to solve real-world
problems in a strongly-typed, functional, algebraic way.

First, let's define data types to represent a single row of our file.
-}

data TradeType
  = Buy
  | Sell
  deriving (Show, Eq, Read)

data Row = Row
  { rowProduct :: String,
    rowTradeType :: TradeType,
    rowCost :: Int
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{-
Now you can implement a function that takes a String containing a single row and
parses it. The only catch here is that the input string might have format
errors. We will simply return an optional result here.

🕯 HINT: You may need to implement your own function to split 'String' by 'Char'.

🕯 HINT: Use the 'readMaybe' function from the 'Text.Read' module.
-}

splitBy :: Char -> String -> [String]
splitBy = go []
  where
    go :: String -> Char -> String -> [String]
    go current _ [] = [current]
    go current sep (x : xs)
      | x == sep = current : splitBy sep xs
      | otherwise = go (current ++ [x]) sep xs

parseRow :: String -> Maybe Row
parseRow s = do
  [a, b, c] <- Just $ splitBy ',' s
  guard $ a /= ""
  tt <- readMaybe b
  cost <- readMaybe c
  guard $ cost >= 0
  pure $ Row a tt cost

{-
We have almost all we need to calculate final stats in a simple and
elegant way.

To use algebraic abstractions for this problem, let's introduce a
custom data type for finding the longest product name.
-}

newtype MaxLen = MaxLen
  { unMaxLen :: String
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{-
We can implement the 'Semigroup' instance for this data type that will
choose between two strings. The instance should return the longest
string.

If both strings have the same length, return the first one.
-}
compareLength :: [a] -> [a] -> Ordering
compareLength [] [] = EQ
compareLength (_ : _) [] = GT
compareLength [] (_ : _) = LT
compareLength (_ : xs) (_ : ys) = compareLength xs ys

instance Semigroup MaxLen where
  (<>) :: MaxLen -> MaxLen -> MaxLen
  (<>) (MaxLen l) (MaxLen k) = case compareLength l k of
    LT -> MaxLen k
    _ -> MaxLen l

instance Monoid MaxLen where
  mempty :: MaxLen
  mempty = MaxLen []

{-
It's convenient to represent our stats as a data type that has
'Semigroup' instance so we can easily combine stats for multiple
lines.
-}

data Stats = Stats
  { statsTotalPositions :: Sum Int,
    statsTotalSum :: Sum Int,
    statsAbsoluteMax :: Max Int,
    statsAbsoluteMin :: Min Int,
    statsSellMax :: Maybe (Max Int),
    statsSellMin :: Maybe (Min Int),
    statsBuyMax :: Maybe (Max Int),
    statsBuyMin :: Maybe (Min Int),
    statsLongest :: MaxLen
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{-
The 'Stats' data type has multiple fields. All these fields have
'Semigroup' instances. This means that we can implement a 'Semigroup'
instance for the 'Stats' type itself.
-}

accMaybe :: Semigroup a => Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
accMaybe a b = case a <> b of
  Nothing -> Nothing
  Just !x -> Just x

instance Semigroup Stats where
  (<>) :: Stats -> Stats -> Stats
  (<>) (Stats tp1 ts1 amax1 amin1 smax1 smin1 bmax1 bmin1 l1) (Stats tp2 ts2 amax2 amin2 smax2 smin2 bmax2 bmin2 l2) =
    Stats (tp1 <> tp2) (ts1 <> ts2) (amax1 <> amax2) (amin1 <> amin2) (smax1 `accMaybe` smax2) (smin1 `accMaybe` smin2) (bmax1 `accMaybe` bmax2) (bmin1 `accMaybe` bmin2) (l1 <> l2)

-- implement Monoid instance for Stats to have the mempty for foldl' in combineRows
instance Monoid Stats where
  mempty :: Stats
  mempty = Stats mempty mempty mempty mempty mempty mempty mempty mempty mempty

{-
The reason for having the 'Stats' data type is to be able to convert
each row independently and then combine all stats into a single one.

Write a function to convert a single 'Row' to 'Stats'. To implement this
function, think about how final stats will look like if you have only a single
row in the file.

🕯 HINT: Since a single row can only be 'Buy' or 'Sell', you can't
   populate both sell max/min and buy max/min values. In that case,
   you can set the corresponding field to 'Nothing'.
-}

rowToStats :: Row -> Stats
rowToStats (Row name Buy amount) = Stats (Sum 1) (Sum (- amount)) (Max amount) (Min amount) Nothing Nothing (Just (Max amount)) (Just (Min amount)) (MaxLen name)
rowToStats (Row name Sell amount) = Stats (Sum 1) (Sum amount) (Max amount) (Min amount) (Just (Max amount)) (Just (Min amount)) Nothing Nothing (MaxLen name)

{-
Now, after we learned to convert a single row, we can convert a list of rows!

However, we have a minor problem. Our 'Stats' data type doesn't have a
'Monoid' instance and it couldn't have it! One reason for this is that
there's no sensible "empty" value for the longest product name. So we
simply don't implement the 'Monoid' instance for 'Stats'.

But the list of rows might be empty and we don't know what to return
on empty list!

The solution of this problem is to propagate handling of this
situation upstream. In our type signature we will require to accept a
non-empty list of rows.

We can use the 'NonEmpty' data type from the 'Data.List.NonEmpty'
module for this purpose. 'NonEmpty' is like 'List1' from Lecture 3
exercises (remember that type?) but with a different constructor.

Have a look at the 'sconcat' function from the 'Semigroup' typeclass to
implement the next task.
-}
-- foldl' :: (Stats -> Row -> Stats) -> Stats -> NonEmpty Row -> Stats
combineRows :: NonEmpty Row -> Stats
--combineRows = sconcat . fmap rowToStats
combineRows = foldl' (<>) mempty . fmap rowToStats

{-
After we've calculated stats for all rows, we can then pretty-print
our final result.

If there's no value for a field (for example, there were not "Buy" products),
you can return string "no value".
-}

displayStats :: Stats -> String
displayStats (Stats tp ts amax amin smax smin bmax bmin l) =
  unlines
    [ "Total positions        : " ++ (show . getSum) tp,
      "Total final balance    : " ++ (show . getSum) ts,
      "Biggest absolute cost  : " ++ (show . getMax) amax,
      "Smallest absolute cost : " ++ (show . getMin) amin,
      "Max earning            : " ++ maybe "no value" (show . getMax) smax,
      "Min earning            : " ++ maybe "no value" (show . getMin) smin,
      "Max spending           : " ++ maybe "no value" (show . getMax) bmax,
      "Min spending           : " ++ maybe "no value" (show . getMin) bmin,
      "Longest product name   : " ++ unMaxLen l
    ]

{-
Now, we definitely have all the pieces in places! We can write a
function that takes the content of the file (the full content with multiple
lines) and converts it to pretty-printed stats.

The only problem here is that after parsing a file we might end with
an empty list of rows but our 'combineRows' function requires to have
a non-empty list. In that case, you can return a string saying that
the file doesn't have any products.

🕯 HINT: Ideally, the implementation of 'calculateStats' should be just a
   composition of several functions. Use already implemented functions, some
   additional standard functions and maybe introduce helper functions if you need.

🕯 HINT: Have a look at 'mapMaybe' function from 'Data.Maybe' (you may need to import it).
-}

calculateStats :: String -> String
calculateStats s = case rows of
  [] -> "file does not contain any products"
  (x : xs) -> displayStats $ combineRows (x :| xs)
  where
    rows = mapMaybe parseRow (lines s)

{- The only thing left is to write a function with side-effects that
takes a path to a file, reads its content, calculates stats and prints
the result.

Use functions 'readFile' and 'putStrLn' here.
-}

printProductStats :: FilePath -> IO ()
printProductStats fp = do
  input <- readFile fp
  putStrLn $ calculateStats input

{-
Okay, I lied. This is not the last thing. Now, we need to wrap
everything together. In our 'main' function, we need to read
command-line arguments that contain a path to a file and then call
'printProductStats' if the arguments contain a path. If they are invalid,
you can print an error message.

Use the 'getArgs' function from the 'System.Environment' module to read
CLI args:

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/System-Environment.html#v:getArgs
-}

main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  case args of
    [] -> putStrLn "please provide a filepath"
    (fp : _) -> printProductStats fp

{-
And that's all!

You solved a difficult problem in functional style! 🥳
You should be proud of yourself 🤗

====================================================

For an extra challenge, you can make sure that your solution is optimally lazy
and streaming. The course contains an additional executable
"generate-many-products" that generates a 2GB file of products.

> NOTE: Make sure you have enough disk space before running the generator and
> make sure to delete the file afterwards to not to waste space

To run the executable that produces a huge file, use the following command:

cabal run generate-many-products

Laziness in Haskell is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it leads to
more composable code and automatic streaming in most cases. On the
other hand, it's easy to introduce space leaks if you're not being
careful.

The naive and straightforward implementation of this task most likely
contains space leaks. To implement the optimal streaming and lazy
solution, consider doing the following improvements:

  1. Enable the {-# LANGUAGE StrictData #-} pragma to this module.

     * Fields in Haskell data types are lazy by default. So, when
       combining 'Stats' with <>, fields on the new 'Stats' value are
       not fully-evaluated. Enabling 'StrictData' fixes this.

  2. Make sure you traverse the list of all products only once in each
     function. In that case, due to laziness, composition of such
     functions will traverse the list only once as well.

     * You can traverse each separate line multiple times because each
       individual line in the file is short and traversing it only
       once won't bring lots of performance improvements.

  3. Don't use 'length' to calculate the total number of rows.

  4. Replace 'sconcat' in 'combineRows' with foldl' or manual recursive
     function using {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} and strict
     accumulator of type 'Stats'.

     * 'sconcat' is a lazy function. So, even if you force every field
       of the 'Stats' data type with 'StrictData', it won't make a
       difference if you don't force the 'Stats' accumulator itself.

  5. Combine fields of type 'Maybe' in the 'Stats' data type with a
     stricter version of '<>'.

     * The 'Semigroup' instance for 'Maybe' (that you've probably used
       for implementing the 'Semigroup' instance for 'Stats') is lazy
       and doesn't force values inside 'Just' constructors. To fix
       this problem, you can use a custom function that combines two
       values of type 'Maybe' and pattern matches on @Just !x@ to
       ensure that values inside 'Just' are fully-evaluated on each
       step.

You can check memory usage of your program by running `htop` in a
separate terminal window. If you see that the memory usage doesn't
grow indefinitely by eating all your RAM, it means that the solution
requires constant-size memory.

Additionally, on Linux, you can run the following command to see the
actual size of required memory during your program execution:

/usr/bin/time -v cabal run lecture4 -- test/gen/big.csv

You can expect the optimal lazy solution to run in ~20 minutes and
consume ~200 MB of RAM. The numbers are not the best and there's lots
of room for optimization! But at least you've managed to implement a
streaming solution using only basic Haskell 🤗
